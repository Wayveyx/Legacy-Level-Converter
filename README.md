# Legacy Level Converter

## How do I use it?

**First,** you’ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
Once that is installed, you will need a command line. On Windows, this is known as the command prompt, and can be launched by typing `cmd` in windows search, or using `Win+R` and using run. For linux users, this is simply Terminal, and can be accessed easily with `Ctrl+Alt+T`.

**Next,** navigate to the folder the converter is in. Once you’re there, Windows users can use the address bar to launch a command line by typing `cmd` in the address bar and pressing `Enter`. Linux users however can use the `cd` command in the terminal to navigate their way to the folder.

**Once inside the folder,** you can set up the configuration inside `conf.json` before running `node main.js <levelID>`. If you would like to change settings on the fly, however, there are command line options you may use. Those will be listed below.
